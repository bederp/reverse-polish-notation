# Reverse Polish Notation
Your job is to create a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation.
For example expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - (which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation) should evaluate to 14.
For your convenience, the input is formatted such that a space is provided between every token.
Empty expression should evaluate to 0.
Valid operations are +, -, *, /.
You may assume that there won't be exceptional situations (like stack underflow or division by zero).

_Please **uphold contract** for this Interface_ as I will provide my own test for your finished task.

This time you need to write your own tests

## How to start
1. Write your own test, use AssertJ 
    1. Read how to use AssertJ - http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/
    2. Add AssertJ library to your project
    3. Write simples test
    
1. Make the test green
1. Add more sophisticated tests
1. Repeat until you are happy with your implementation
    1. Consider using data structure which suites this problem
